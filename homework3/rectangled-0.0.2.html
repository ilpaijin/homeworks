Specifications:

	- The above pseudo-constant values may vary. However, it is guaranteed that:

		a) maxRectDim <= containerWidth / 3
			and
		b) maxRectDim <= containerHeight / 3

	- The action takes place in a (containerWidth x containerHeight) container random-color div with top-left corder at 0,0 screen (window) coordinates.

	- On load, nRectangles random-sized (each side minRectDim to maxRectDim pixels included) and random-color rectangles are displayed according to the following rules:
	
		a) They must be fully contained within the container div
		b) Their position is random
		c) They're all assigned a unique z-index

		The mouse cursor position at load is ignored.

	- Each time a mouse cursor is positioned over a visible part of a rectangle, that rectangle must change color to a new random color.

	- If the cursor remains over for 3 seconds, the rectangle is re-positioned (no animation) in such a way that:

		a) The new position is random, given the following two constraints
		b) It is no longer under the mouse cursor position
		c) It is still fully visible within the container div
		d) It gains the highest z-index, while the z-index order of other rectangles remains unchanged

Further notes:

	- You may use a framework, yet raw DOM would be appreciated.

	- Focus on clean and readable/understandable code before focusing on performance.
